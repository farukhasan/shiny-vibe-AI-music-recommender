## Methodology

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw text data is collected and preprocessed
2. **Text Cleaning**: Removal of noise, special characters, and standardization
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of relevant features for sentiment analysis
4. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into meaningful components
5. **Sentiment Scoring**: Application of machine learning models for sentiment prediction

### Machine Learning Implementation

#### Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
The dashboard utilizes Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms for sentiment classification:

- **Model Training**: Sequential learning approach where each model corrects errors from previous iterations
- **Feature Selection**: Automated selection of most predictive text features
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of learning rate, tree depth, and regularization parameters
- **Cross-validation**: Robust model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation

#### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: High precision sentiment classification
- **Scalability**: Efficient processing of large text datasets
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis for model transparency
- **Robustness**: Handling of various text formats and languages

```

## Deployment Process

### Shinyapps.io Deployment

The application is deployed using shinyapps.io, RStudio's cloud-based hosting platform for Shiny applications.

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Account Setup**:
   - Create an account at [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
   - Configure deployment credentials in RStudio

2. **Application Preparation**:
   - Ensure all required packages are listed in the application
   - Optimize code for cloud deployment
   - Test application locally before deployment

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   ```r
   # Install rsconnect package
   install.packages("rsconnect")
   
   # Configure account credentials
   rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
     name = "farukhasan",
     token = "your_token_here",
     secret = "your_secret_here"
   )
   ```

4. **Deploy Application**:
   ```r
   # Deploy to shinyapps.io
   rsconnect::deployApp(
     appDir = "path/to/your/app",
     appName = "vibe_ai",
     forceUpdate = TRUE
   )
   ```
